Dear Fred,

We are sending this email to notify you that your home is on fire. As the Protection Agency Against Fire and Water Damage, it is our responsibility to alert you of such things. Also, your possessions are at risk of external combustion and explosion. Therefore, it is imperative that we send you this message, and that you receive this message as soon as possible. If you do not see this message after ten seconds of us sending it, the entire structure of your house will collapse and everything you own currently in that house will be gone forever.

Thank you for your consideration and responsiveness.
The Protection Agency Against Fire and Water Damage.
